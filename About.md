**_"It takes two to tango"_** is a common expression which suggests that an outcome
(often one with negative consequences) cannot be wholly attributed to the actions 
of just one individual or group, but rather reflects the dynamic between two or more
indivuals or groups whose actions are linked.

The tango is a dance which requires two partners moving in relation to each other, 
sometimes in tandem, sometimes independently, or even in opposition to each other.
The meaning of this expression has been extended to include any situation in which
an understanding of the role played by two or more partners is essential to 
understanding the outcome.

**_"It takes 10 to tango"_** is our team's interpretation of this expression, 
using the binary two (10).

It reflects our commitment to work together to achieve 
an outcome that reflects our individual contributions, yet is more than the sum
of it's parts.
