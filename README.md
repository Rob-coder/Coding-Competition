# Coding-Competition

# What is this repo?
This is a shared Repo for our team ("It Takes 10 to Tango") in the Code Competition 2019

# How does it work?

Team members can use the repo to fork, amend, and merge-back code and other documents created in the course of the project

# Who will use this repo or project?
Team members and mentors

We are a team of 5 workmates who have come together to enter this coding competition, so that we can learn new skills

We also have two mentors (experienced developers) who we can call on to guide our work (but not to do it for us !)

What is the goal of this project?
To produce a solution that meets the challenge to produce an Alexa Skill that supports Learning Through Play

We think, initially, that we might produce a skill that helps users learn the Capital Cities of various Countries
